# Modelling Data & Spreadsheets 
## What is Data Modelling?
Data Modelling is the process of investigating real life scenarios from current or previous data by creating a visual representation of the outcome. A great example of this definition are businesses using previous sales data to predict which product is more profitable or weather forecasters using a model of the atmosphere to predict the weather.
