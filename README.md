# Modelling Data 
## What is Data Modelling?
Data Modelling is the process of investigating real life scenarios from current or previous data by creating a visual representation of the outcome. A great example of this definition are businesses using previous sales data to predict which product is more profitable or weather forecasters using a model of the atmosphere to predict the weather. Using Microsoft Excel I created a spreadsheet model based on a dataset I downloaded from Kaggle.com which was based on petrol consumption. I then used the information in the dataset to base it on cities across the UK to create a hypothetical scenario. To begin modelling the data I did some basic calculations and used built in formulas within Microsoft Excel such as AUTOSUM, MAX, MIN, AVERAGE, COUNT and COUNTIF. I used the VLOOKUP formula to make it easier to look up specific information in the dataset. Microsoft has a great feature known as Validation which allows you to control the type of data entered in your worksheet. Using the Validation function I was able to ensure only data from 2019 was entered.

## Data Visualisations
To present the data I created 2 graphs; ! created a graph to visualise the average pertol tax based on income. The second graph visualises the number of paved highways based on cities in the UK.
